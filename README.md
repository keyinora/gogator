# Create a readme based off this.

I don't normally do this with guided projects, but I want you to take some time and document your program. Treat it as if you were releasing it for other developers to use.

Assignment
Create a README.md file in the root of your repo if you don't have one already. (You should be tracking your changes with Git.)
Explain to the user that they'll need Postgres and Go installed to run the program.
Explain to the user how to install the gator CLI using go install.
Explain to the user how to set up the config file and run the program. Tell them about a few of the commands they can run.
Push gator up to GitHub, then submit the link to your remote repo. Your link should look something like this: https://github.com/github-username/repo-name.
Remember: Go programs are statically compiled binaries. After running go build or go install, you should be able to run your code without needing the go toolchain.

go run . is just for development. gator is for production.

Here's a sample README.md file based on your instructions:

# Gator CLI

A command-line tool for managing feeds and posts, built with Go and PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

To run Gator, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database. You can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- **Go**: The Go programming language. Installation instructions are available on the [official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).


## Installation

### Install Gator CLI

To install the Gator CLI tool, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go install github.com/your-github-username/gator@latest
```

This will download and compile the binary for Gator, placing it in your Go bin directory.

### Setup Configuration File

Before running Gator, you need to configure it by setting up a YAML configuration file. Here’s an example of a simple configuration file:

```yaml
currentUserName: "user123"
database:
  user: "your-postgres-username"
  password: "your-postgres-password"
  dbname: "gator"
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
```

Place this configuration file at `~/.gator/config.yaml` or any location you prefer and make sure to specify its path when running Gator.

## Running Gator

After installation and configuration, you can run Gator using the following commands:

- **Register a new user**: `gator register <username>`
- **Log in as an existing user**: `gator login <username>`
- **Add a new feed and follow it**: `gator addfeed "feedname" "feedurl"`
- **List all feeds**: `gator feeds`
- **Follow an existing feed**: `gator follow feedurl`
- **List all feeds followed by the current user**: `gator following`
- **Unfollow a feed**: `gator unfollow feedurl`
- **Aggregate posts from RSS feeds at intervals**: `gator agg 10m`
- **Browse posts for the current user**: `gator browse`


## Deployment

Gator is designed to be a statically compiled binary. After running `go build` or `go install`, you can run your code without needing the Go toolchain. Use `go run .` for development purposes and the compiled binary for production.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or contact us at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com).

### Pushing to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Initialize your local repository with `git init`.
3. Add your files with `git add .`.
4. Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
5. Link your local repository to GitHub with `git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-username/repo-name.git`.
6. Push your changes to GitHub with `git push -u origin main`.

Your repository link should look like this: `https://github.com/your-github-username/repo-name`.
